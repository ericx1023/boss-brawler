      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Firebase project setup task into logical groupings focusing on: 1) Initial project configuration, 2) Cloud Functions environment setup, and 3) Endpoint implementation and deployment",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard Firebase setup procedures with moderate complexity. The steps follow a logical progression and are well-defined. The task requires working with multiple services (Firebase console, CLI, Cloud Functions) but follows standard patterns. Three subtasks would effectively group the initial setup, function configuration, and deployment phases."

      "taskTitle": "Integrate Vertex AI Gemini API",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Vertex AI integration task into subtasks focusing on: 1) Authentication and environment setup, 2) Core API client implementation, 3) Prompt template management, and 4) Testing and error handling",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity due to working with advanced AI APIs and requiring careful implementation of prompt engineering. It involves SDK integration, authentication, error handling, and designing the interaction patterns. Four subtasks would help manage the complexity by separating configuration, core functionality, prompt management, and reliability aspects."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the conversation storage implementation into: 1) Database schema design and validation rules, 2) Core CRUD operations for conversations, and 3) Session management functionality",
      "reasoning": "This task involves database design and implementation with moderate complexity. It requires creating a well-structured data model and implementing various operations. The task is well-defined but requires careful consideration of data structure and access patterns. Three subtasks would effectively separate the design, core operations, and session management aspects."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the AI analysis feature into: 1) Analysis prompt engineering and metrics definition, 2) Analysis trigger and processing logic, 3) Results storage and integration with conversation flow, and 4) Testing and refinement of analysis quality",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity as it involves advanced prompt engineering for analysis, determining when to trigger analysis, and integrating the results meaningfully. It requires deep understanding of both the AI capabilities and the negotiation domain. Four subtasks would help manage complexity by separating prompt design, processing logic, integration, and quality refinement."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the primary chat endpoint implementation into: 1) Endpoint structure and request validation, 2) Session and context management integration, 3) AI response generation and analysis incorporation, and 4) Security, error handling and performance optimization",
      "reasoning": "This task represents the core integration point with high complexity due to combining multiple components (session management, AI interaction, analysis). It requires careful error handling and security considerations. Four subtasks would effectively separate the API structure, context management, core functionality, and reliability aspects."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the chat UI development into: 1) Message display components (bubbles, feedback styling), 2) Input components and controls, and 3) Layout, responsiveness and animations",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating multiple UI components with moderate to high complexity. It requires attention to detail for visual design and user experience. The task includes animations and responsive design considerations. Three subtasks would effectively separate the message display, input mechanisms, and overall UX components."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the API client implementation into: 1) Core service structure and endpoint methods, 2) Data models and serialization, and 3) Error handling, retry logic and testing utilities",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard API client implementation with moderate complexity. It requires creating data models, handling errors, and implementing network communication. The task follows established patterns but requires careful error handling. Three subtasks would effectively separate the core service, data handling, and reliability components."

      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity due to managing application state across multiple components and handling various state transitions. It requires careful design of the state architecture and connecting it to the UI. Four subtasks would help manage complexity by separating architecture, UI integration, action handling, and analytics aspects."
