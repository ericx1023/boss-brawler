# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop AI Analysis Feature
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create functionality to analyze user responses and provide structured feedback on negotiation skills
# Details:
1. Design analysis prompt template with specific evaluation metrics (clarity, assertiveness)
2. Implement Cloud Function to process user messages for analysis
3. Create structured format for feedback responses
4. Develop logic to determine when to trigger analysis (e.g., after X messages)
5. Integrate analysis results into the conversation flow
6. Store analysis results in Firestore linked to the conversation
7. Implement error handling specific to analysis functionality

# Test Strategy:
Test analysis with various negotiation responses ranging from poor to excellent. Verify feedback is actionable and relevant. Test error cases and edge cases with unusual inputs.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Analysis Prompt Template and Define Evaluation Metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive prompt template for the AI to analyze negotiation responses and define clear evaluation metrics for assessment
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Research effective negotiation evaluation frameworks
2. Define 3-5 specific evaluation metrics (e.g., clarity, assertiveness, flexibility, empathy)
3. Create scoring criteria for each metric (e.g., 1-5 scale with specific descriptions)
4. Design a prompt template that instructs the AI to analyze responses according to these metrics
5. Include instructions for providing constructive feedback in the prompt
6. Create examples of good/poor responses for each metric as reference
7. Test the prompt with sample negotiation responses
8. Refine the prompt based on test results

Testing approach:
- Create a set of sample negotiation responses (varying in quality)
- Test the prompt with these samples to ensure consistent and meaningful evaluations
- Have team members review the analysis results for accuracy and helpfulness

## 2. Implement Analysis Trigger Logic and Processing Function [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop the Cloud Function to process user messages and implement logic to determine when analysis should be triggered
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a new Cloud Function that accepts user messages for analysis
2. Implement logic to determine when analysis should be triggered:
   - After a specific number of user messages (configurable parameter)
   - When user explicitly requests feedback
   - At key negotiation stages (e.g., initial offer, counteroffers)
3. Set up API call to the AI service using the prompt template from subtask 1
4. Process the AI response to extract structured feedback
5. Format the analysis results in a consistent structure (JSON)
6. Implement error handling for API failures and unexpected responses
7. Add logging for debugging and monitoring

Testing approach:
- Unit test the trigger logic with various conversation scenarios
- Test the Cloud Function with mock API responses
- End-to-end test with real API calls to verify correct processing
- Verify error handling by simulating various failure conditions

## 3. Develop Analysis Storage and Conversation Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Create the system to store analysis results in Firestore and integrate feedback into the conversation flow
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design Firestore schema for storing analysis results
2. Create data model that links analysis results to specific conversations and messages
3. Implement functions to save analysis results to Firestore
4. Develop helper functions to retrieve and format analysis for display
5. Integrate analysis results into the conversation flow:
   - Format feedback messages for display in the chat
   - Create UI components to present analysis in a user-friendly way
   - Implement logic to present analysis at appropriate points in conversation
   - **Implementation Plan:**
     - Define a special marker (e.g., `[ANALYSIS]:`) for analysis messages.
     - Use a custom `responseBuilder` in `LlmChatView` within `chat_page.dart`.
     - The `responseBuilder` will check for the marker.
     - If the marker is present, render the message using a new custom widget (`AnalysisFeedbackView`) for structured display (e.g., cards, lists).
     - Otherwise, render the message normally.
     - Create `AnalysisFeedbackView` widget in `ai/example/lib/widgets/analysis_feedback_view.dart`.
6. Add functionality to allow users to request additional details on specific feedback points
7. Implement caching for performance optimization

Testing approach:
- Verify correct storage and retrieval of analysis data
- Test UI rendering of feedback in different conversation scenarios
- Validate data integrity with concurrent analysis requests
- Performance testing for large conversation histories

## 4. Implement Testing Framework and Refine Analysis Quality [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Create a comprehensive testing framework to evaluate and improve the quality of negotiation analysis
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Develop a test suite with diverse negotiation scenarios and expected outcomes
2. Create a feedback collection mechanism for users to rate the helpfulness of analysis
3. Implement A/B testing capability to compare different prompt versions
4. Set up analytics to track key metrics:
   - Analysis accuracy (via user feedback)
   - User improvement over time
   - Common areas where users struggle
5. Create a dashboard to visualize analysis quality metrics
6. Develop a process for regular prompt refinement based on collected data
7. Implement versioning for prompts to track changes and their impact
8. Create documentation for maintaining and improving the analysis system

Testing approach:
- Run the test suite against multiple prompt versions
- Conduct user testing sessions with real users
- Analyze user feedback data to identify improvement areas
- Verify that refinements to the prompts improve analysis quality metrics
