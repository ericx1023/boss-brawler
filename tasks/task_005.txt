# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create Primary Chat API Endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the main chat endpoint that handles message processing, AI interaction, and returns responses to frontend
# Details:
1. Create `/chat_message` HTTPS Cloud Function endpoint
2. Implement request validation and parameter extraction
3. Integrate session management to maintain conversation context
4. Connect to Vertex AI for generating responses
5. Include logic to trigger and incorporate analysis feedback when appropriate
6. Structure response format for frontend consumption
7. Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
8. Add rate limiting and security measures

# Test Strategy:
Test the endpoint with various request scenarios including new sessions and existing sessions. Verify response format matches frontend requirements. Test error handling with malformed requests and API failures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create HTTPS Cloud Function Endpoint with Request Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the basic `/chat_message` HTTPS Cloud Function endpoint with request validation and parameter extraction logic
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a new Cloud Function with HTTPS trigger at `/chat_message` endpoint
2. Implement request schema validation to verify required parameters (userId, message, sessionId)
3. Extract and sanitize request parameters
4. Set up basic logging structure to track request processing
5. Create the response structure template that will be populated later
6. Implement initial error handling for malformed requests

Testing approach:
- Create unit tests for request validation with valid and invalid payloads
- Test parameter extraction with various input formats
- Verify error responses for invalid requests have appropriate status codes and messages

## 2. Implement Session Management and Context Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Add session management functionality to maintain conversation context across multiple interactions
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Integrate with Firestore or similar database to store and retrieve session data
2. Create functions to initialize new sessions when needed
3. Implement logic to retrieve existing conversation history based on sessionId
4. Design context window management to maintain appropriate conversation length
5. Add functionality to update session data after each interaction
6. Structure conversation history in a format suitable for AI model consumption

Testing approach:
- Test session creation, retrieval, and updating with mock database
- Verify context windowing correctly limits conversation history
- Test session continuity across multiple requests with the same sessionId
- Validate error handling for session retrieval failures

## 3. Integrate Vertex AI and Implement Response Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Connect to Vertex AI for generating responses and incorporate analysis feedback when appropriate
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Set up Vertex AI client integration with appropriate authentication
2. Format conversation context from session data for the AI model
3. Implement the main response generation logic using Vertex AI
4. Create mechanism to determine when analysis feedback should be triggered
5. Design logic to incorporate analysis results into the prompt or response
6. Format AI responses for frontend consumption with necessary metadata
7. Implement retry logic for AI service failures

Testing approach:
- Create mock Vertex AI responses to test integration
- Test conversation formatting with various session histories
- Verify analysis feedback integration works as expected
- Test error handling for AI service failures
- Validate response formatting meets frontend requirements

## 4. Implement Security, Error Handling, and Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Add security measures, comprehensive error handling, and performance optimizations to the chat endpoint
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse (e.g., using Firebase or a custom solution)
2. Add authentication verification to ensure only authorized users can access the endpoint
3. Enhance error handling with detailed error codes and user-friendly messages
4. Implement comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
5. Add performance monitoring metrics (latency, success rate, etc.)
6. Optimize response time by implementing caching where appropriate
7. Set up appropriate CORS configuration for frontend access
8. Implement request timeout handling

Testing approach:
- Test rate limiting with rapid successive requests
- Verify authentication requirements prevent unauthorized access
- Test error handling for various failure scenarios (AI unavailable, database errors, etc.)
- Measure and validate performance under load
- Test CORS configuration with frontend requests
