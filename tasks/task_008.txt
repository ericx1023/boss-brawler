# Task ID: 8
# Title: Create Frontend API Client
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a service in Flutter to communicate with the backend API endpoints.
# Details:
Create ApiService class to handle HTTP requests to backend. Implement methods for sending messages and context to /chat_message endpoint. Add error handling for network issues and API errors. Create data models matching backend (ChatMessage, ChatSession). Implement serialization/deserialization of API requests and responses.

# Test Strategy:
Test API client with mock responses. Verify correct handling of successful responses and errors. Test timeout handling and retry logic. Ensure data models correctly parse API responses.
