# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement API Client Service
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create service layer in Flutter to communicate with backend API endpoints
# Details:
1. Create API client service class
2. Implement methods for all backend endpoints (health check, chat, etc.)
3. Add request/response serialization and deserialization
4. Implement error handling and retry logic
5. Create models for structured data exchange
6. Add authentication handling if required
7. Implement timeout handling and connection status monitoring
8. Create mock API responses for development and testing

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for API client methods. Test serialization/deserialization with sample data. Verify error handling works correctly for various failure scenarios. Test with mock responses before connecting to real backend.
