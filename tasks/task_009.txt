# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop state management solution to handle chat session state and UI updates
# Details:
1. Choose appropriate state management approach (Provider, Bloc, etc.)
2. Implement chat session state model
3. Create state transitions for loading, success, and error states
4. Connect UI components to state
5. Implement message handling logic
6. Add session persistence for app restarts
7. Create actions for user interactions (send message, start new session)
8. Implement analytics tracking for key user actions

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for state transitions. Test state persistence across app restarts. Verify UI correctly reflects different states. Test concurrent operations and error recovery.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up State Management Architecture and Models [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the core state management architecture and define data models for the chat session state
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Choose and set up a state management approach (Provider recommended for simplicity, or BLoC for more complex scenarios)
2. Define ChatSession model with properties for messages, session status, user info, and timestamps
3. Create Message model with properties for content, timestamp, sender, status (sent/delivered/read)
4. Implement ChatState class with different state types (initial, loading, loaded, error)
5. Set up the basic state container that will hold the application state
6. Define interfaces for state operations

Testing approach:
- Unit test the models with sample data
- Verify state transitions work correctly in isolation
- Test serialization/deserialization of models for persistence

## 2. Implement UI State Binding and Transitions [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Connect UI components to state and implement state transitions for different app states
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create state provider/bloc that UI components can listen to
2. Implement loading, success, and error states with appropriate UI feedback
3. Set up state listeners in chat screen and message list components
4. Create UI update mechanisms that respond to state changes
5. Implement conditional rendering based on current state (loading spinner, error messages, etc.)
6. Add animations for state transitions where appropriate

Testing approach:
- Write widget tests to verify UI updates correctly when state changes
- Test edge cases like empty states and error handling
- Verify loading indicators appear and disappear appropriately

## 3. Implement User Actions and Session Persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Create actions for user interactions and implement session persistence across app restarts
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Implement action handlers for user interactions (send message, start new chat, etc.)
2. Create a message queue system to handle message sending states
3. Implement optimistic updates for better UX
4. Set up local storage for persisting chat sessions (using SharedPreferences or Hive)
5. Implement serialization/deserialization of chat state
6. Add logic to restore state when app restarts
7. Handle edge cases like failed message sends and retry mechanisms

Testing approach:
- Test persistence by simulating app restarts
- Verify all user actions correctly modify the state
- Test offline capabilities and synchronization
- Verify error handling and retry mechanisms work as expected

## 4. Integrate Analytics and Performance Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Add analytics tracking for key user actions and optimize state management performance
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Define key events to track (session start, message sent, errors encountered)
2. Integrate analytics service (Firebase Analytics or similar)
3. Add analytics event tracking to key user actions
4. Implement custom analytics parameters for detailed tracking
5. Set up performance monitoring for state transitions
6. Optimize state updates to prevent unnecessary rebuilds
7. Add logging for debugging state issues

Testing approach:
- Verify analytics events are fired correctly using debug mode
- Test performance with large chat histories
- Measure and optimize rebuild counts
- Ensure analytics doesn't impact app performance
