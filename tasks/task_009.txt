# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Chat State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create state management solution to handle the chat session state in the Flutter app.
# Details:
Implement ChatController or state management class to maintain current conversation state. Create methods to add new messages, send messages to API, and update UI. Implement loading states for pending API requests. Handle displaying AI responses and analysis in the chat view. Manage context input visibility based on session state.

# Test Strategy:
Test state updates when sending messages. Verify UI updates correctly when new messages arrive. Test error handling and recovery. Ensure state is maintained consistently throughout the chat flow.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create ChatController class with basic state structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core ChatController class with state management capabilities to maintain the chat session state
### Details:
1. Create a new ChatController class that will use a state management approach (e.g., Provider, Bloc, or GetX)
2. Define the core state properties: messages list, loading status, error state, and context input visibility flag
3. Implement basic state initialization and reset functionality
4. Create a message model class with fields for content, timestamp, sender (user/AI), and message status
5. Add methods to get the current state and listen to state changes
6. Test the controller initialization and basic state management with unit tests

## 2. Implement message handling and management methods [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Add methods to the ChatController for adding, updating, and managing messages in the conversation
### Details:
1. Implement addMessage() method to add new user messages to the state
2. Create updateMessage() method to modify existing messages (e.g., when API responses arrive)
3. Add message validation logic to prevent empty messages
4. Implement methods to clear conversation history or remove specific messages
5. Add functionality to track and manage message status (sending, sent, failed, etc.)
6. Create methods to handle typing indicators and message timestamps
7. Test message addition, updating, and management with unit tests to verify correct state transitions

## 3. Integrate API communication for sending and receiving messages [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Add API integration to the ChatController to handle sending messages and processing responses
### Details:
1. Create methods to prepare and send messages to the API endpoint
2. Implement loading state management during API requests
3. Add error handling for API communication failures
4. Process API responses and update the message state accordingly
5. Implement retry logic for failed message sends
6. Create methods to handle AI analysis responses and special message types
7. Add rate limiting or throttling if needed
8. Test API integration with mock HTTP client to verify correct handling of success and error scenarios

## 4. Implement UI state coordination and context visibility management [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Add methods to coordinate UI updates based on chat state and manage context input visibility
### Details:
1. Create methods to notify UI of state changes for efficient rebuilds
2. Implement logic to manage context input visibility based on session state
3. Add functionality to scroll to latest messages automatically
4. Create methods to handle UI-specific states like scrolling position and focus management
5. Implement methods to track and display typing indicators
6. Add support for UI theming based on message sender
7. Create integration tests to verify correct UI updates in response to state changes
8. Implement methods to handle different view states (empty chat, loading, error, active conversation)
