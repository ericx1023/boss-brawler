# Task ID: 10
# Title: Integrate End-to-End Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Connect all frontend and backend components to enable complete user flow from context input to chat with feedback
# Details:
1. Connect Flutter app to deployed Cloud Functions
2. Implement complete user flow from app launch to chat completion
3. Add session management UI (create new, resume existing)
4. Integrate context input with chat initialization
5. Connect chat UI to backend via API client
6. Implement proper handling of analysis feedback in the UI
7. Add error handling and recovery for end-user experience
8. Perform end-to-end testing and bug fixes

# Test Strategy:
Conduct full end-to-end testing of user flows. Test with various network conditions including poor connectivity. Verify all components work together correctly. Test on multiple device types and OS versions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Backend-Frontend Connection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement API client in the Flutter app to connect with deployed Cloud Functions
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create an API client class in the Flutter app that handles HTTP requests to the Cloud Functions
2. Implement authentication handling for secure API calls
3. Define API endpoints for all required functionality (context submission, chat initialization, message sending/receiving)
4. Create response models to parse API responses
5. Implement error handling for network issues and API errors
6. Add logging for debugging purposes

Testing approach:
1. Write unit tests for the API client methods
2. Create mock responses to test parsing logic
3. Test authentication flow
4. Verify proper error handling with intentionally failed requests

## 2. Implement Complete User Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Connect all UI components with backend services to create seamless user experience from app launch to chat completion
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Integrate context input UI with the API client to submit user context
2. Connect chat initialization with context processing results
3. Implement message sending/receiving in the chat UI using the API client
4. Add loading states and progress indicators during API calls
5. Implement proper state management to maintain conversation flow
6. Connect analysis feedback components to display insights from backend
7. Ensure proper data flow between all screens and components

Testing approach:
1. Create integration tests for the main user flows
2. Test with various input scenarios (short/long context, different types of queries)
3. Verify that UI updates correctly based on backend responses
4. Test navigation between different screens in the flow

## 3. Implement Session Management and Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Add functionality to manage chat sessions and implement comprehensive error handling for better user experience
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create session management UI (create new session, resume existing session)
2. Implement local storage for saving session data
3. Add session synchronization with backend
4. Implement error recovery mechanisms for various failure scenarios
5. Create user-friendly error messages for different types of errors
6. Add retry functionality for failed operations
7. Implement offline mode detection and appropriate user feedback
8. Add session timeout handling and reconnection logic

Testing approach:
1. Test session creation, saving, and resuming
2. Simulate various error conditions and verify recovery
3. Test app behavior under poor network conditions
4. Verify that user data is properly persisted between sessions

## 4. Perform End-to-End Testing and Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Conduct comprehensive testing, fix bugs, and optimize performance across the entire application
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create end-to-end test scenarios covering all user flows
2. Implement automated UI tests for critical paths
3. Conduct performance profiling to identify bottlenecks
4. Optimize API calls (implement caching, reduce payload size)
5. Improve UI rendering performance
6. Fix identified bugs and issues
7. Implement analytics to track user behavior and error rates
8. Conduct usability testing and implement feedback

Testing approach:
1. Run comprehensive test suite across different devices and screen sizes
2. Measure and benchmark performance metrics (response times, memory usage)
3. Conduct beta testing with real users
4. Verify analytics data collection accuracy
5. Test edge cases and uncommon usage patterns
