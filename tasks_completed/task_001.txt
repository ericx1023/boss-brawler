# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Backend Project Structure
# Status: completed
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Python backend project with FastAPI/Flask, configure project structure, and setup basic API routing.
# Details:
Create a new Python project with virtual environment. Install FastAPI/Flask and required dependencies. Setup project structure with routes, controllers, and services folders. Implement health check endpoint and basic error handling middleware. Configure CORS to allow requests from Flutter app.

# Test Strategy:
Verify server starts correctly. Test health check endpoint returns 200 OK. Ensure CORS headers are properly set for cross-origin requests.

# Completion Notes:
Successfully set up the backend project structure using FastAPI. Created the following components:
- Project structure with appropriate folders (routes, controllers, services, models, utils)
- Health check endpoint at root (/)
- Basic error handling middleware
- CORS configuration
- Initial route structure with API prefix
- Data models for chat messages and sessions
- Environment configuration
- README and requirements.txt

The server can successfully import the modules, though we had an issue with the server running that needs to be addressed in future commits.
